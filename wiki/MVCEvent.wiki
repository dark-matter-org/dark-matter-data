#summary The MvcEvent Definition

= The MvcEvent Definition =

The `MvcEvent` Definition is one of the primary aspects of the DM-MVC mechanisms, since all Events that are generated or handled by [MVCController Controllers] or [MVCView Views] must be explicitly defined.

The `MvcEvent` has the following attributes:

<table width="820">

<tr>
<td width="120" valign="top">
*`name`*
</td>
<td valign="top">
the name of this event. This name should be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase camelCase], globally unique name for your event. Since this name is actually embedded in code, don't use anything other than [a-z][A-Z] characters.

If you are dealing with large numbers of events and are afraid of overlapping names, you may want to use a convention of using a standard prefix on event names defined in related DM-MVC configurations.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">
*`description`*
</td>
<td valign="top">
a useful indication of when the Event indicates has happened. No need to be long winded, since the event name should be descriptive enough in most cases.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">
*`userDataType`*
</td>
<td valign="top">
Column 2

</tr>
