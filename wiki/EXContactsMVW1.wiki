#summary Getting started with the Contacts example in MVW.

<wiki:toc />

= Introduction =

This tutorial assumes that:

  * you have [http://http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] installed
  * you have the [https://developers.google.com/eclipse/ GWT Eclipse plugin]
  * you are using (or have available) the [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=gwt-2.2.0.zip GWT 2.2.0 SDK]. See the [EXContactsMVW1#Installing_a_GWT_SDK Installing a GWT SDK] section if you need a hand with this.


== Import the dark-matter-data project ==

Import the dark-matter-data project into your workspace. This can be accomplished in a couple of ways:
  * checkout the dark-matter-data project from Google Code, the SVN URL is `https://dark-matter-data.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`<p/>Note: the eclipse project is below the `dark-matter-data` folder beneath `trunk` and is also called `dark-matter-data`.<p/>
  * OR grab the latest dark-matter-data.zip file from the [http://code.google.com/p/dark-matter-data/downloads/list Downloads Page].<p/>Unzip the file and use the File->Import - General - Existing Projects into Workspace to load the project.

Usually, you would just use the dark-matter-data JAR, but, since this is a tutorial, it is useful to have access to the full dark-matter code base.

== Import the dark-matter-contacts project ==

Import the dark-matter-contacts project into your workspace, again, using your preferred method:
  * checkout dark-matter-contacts from `https://dark-matter-contacts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk` <p/>
  * OR grab the latest dark-matter-contacts.zip from the [http://code.google.com/p/dark-matter-data/downloads/list Downloads Page].<p/>Unzip the file and use the File->Import - General - Existing Projects into Workspace to load the project.

Note: you may have to set the GWT SDK on the contacts project. Right click the project in the package explorer and select `Google->Web Toolkit Settings`
