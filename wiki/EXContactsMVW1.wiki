= Introduction =

This tutorial assumes that:

  * you have [http://http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] installed
  * you have the [https://developers.google.com/eclipse/ GWT Eclipse plugin]
  * you are using (or have available) the [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=gwt-2.2.0.zip GWT 2.2.0 SDK]


== Import the dark-matter-data project ==

Import the dark-matter-data project into your workspace.

The SVN URL is `https://dark-matter-data.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`. 

Note: the eclipse project is below the `dark-matter-data` folder beneath `trunk` and is also called `dark-matter-data`.

Usually, you would just use the dark-matter JAR, but, since this is a tutorial, it is useful to have access to the full dark-matter code base.

== Import the dark-matter-contacts project ==

The SVN URL is `https://dark-matter-contacts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`.

Note: you may have to set the GWT SDK on the contacts project. Right click the project in the package explorer and select `Google->Web Toolkit Settings`
