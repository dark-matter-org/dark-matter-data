= Creating a New GWT Project and Using Dark Matter =

== Create the GWT Project ==

Use your preferred method, following the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html#create instructions] for creating the application from within Eclipse or using the `webAppCreator` command line tool.

If you're not familiar with running in [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/create.html#test development mode], continue a little further in the documentation.

The sample dark-matter-stock 

== Set up your Dark Matter Schema ==

Your project folders should look something like:

{{{
/src/xxx/yyy/zzz/
                 client
                 server
                 shared
                 application.gwt.xml
}}}

Schema is a shared resource so create the following folder structure beneath the shared folder:

{{{
/src/xxx/yyy/zzz/shared/
                        dmdcofig/vodot1/
                                        myapp.dms
                                        attributes.dmd
                                        classes.dmd
}}}
