However, trying to reconcile these ideas into something coherent and systematic was leaving me with conceptual indigestion.

The Model View Whatever (MVW) framework and code generation mechanisms are meant to provide a consistent conceptual view of the various aspects presented by these articles. The goal of MVW is to leverage the basic concepts of the dark-matter framework and combine them with MVP to create a clear methodology for the development of complex GWT applications.
