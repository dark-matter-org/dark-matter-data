#summary An overview of Dark Matter Objects.

= Dark Matter Object =

A Dark Matter Object (DMO - pronounced dee mo) is a standard Java object that is generated by the [DMOGenerator DMO Generator] tool. All DMOs derive from [http://code.google.com/p/dark-matter-data/source/browse/trunk/%20dark-matter-data/dark-matter-data/src/org/dmd/dmc/DmcObject.java org.dmd.dmc.DmcObject], sometimes referred to as the Dark Matter Core object. Despite being a fairly large class, the DmcObject just provides a holder for a collection of attributes; that's basically it.

Instead of generating classes that have discrete member attributes, Dark Matter relies on a hash map of attribute containers that hold the attribute values, either single or multi-valued. This approach may seem odd, but it allows for a great deal of common functionality to be provided by DmcObject. This functionality includes:

 * standard presentation of a DMO in [ObjectInstanceFormat Object Instance Format] (OIF)
 * standard presentation in [http://www.json.org/ JSON] format
 * the ability to access attributes by name (very handy for data binding in various frameworks)
 * the ability to serialize the object in a manner very similar to [http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/ Google Protocol Buffers]
 * the ability to record modifications made to object so that these modifications can be transmitted in a [DarkMatterProtocol Dark Matter Protocol] `SetRequest` or in a [DarkMatterProtocol Dark Matter Protocol] event.
 * the ability to perform [LazyObjectReferenceResolution Lazy Object Reference Resolution]
 * the ability to perform [BackReferenceTracking Back Reference Tracking]
 * the ability to automatically remove references to an object when it is deleted (which does not depend on the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html Weak Reference] concept. This is useful in GWT environments where the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/RefJreEmulation.html JRE Emulation] does not support WeakReference
 * the ability cast a DMO to the appropriate type of [DarkMatterWrapper Dark Matter Wrapper] object that provides behavior in a particular operational context
 * the ability to take a [Slice Slice] of an object i.e. to grab a subset of its attributes; very handy when you only need summary information from an object when it is first displayed by a client
 * the ability to
