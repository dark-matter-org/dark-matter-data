= The Contacts Example with Dark Matter =

This page outlines the steps required to recreate the behaviour of the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture-2.html Tutorial Contacts2] example using Dark Matter mechanisms.

== Create a New Web Application Project ==

Create the new project:

<img width="250" src="http://www.dark-matter-data.org/images/dmcNewWebApp.png" />

In this case it's called dark-matter-contacts and we're using the same package structure as the contacts example.

Ensure that Google App Engine is unchecked:

You can toast the FieldVerifier.java.

== The Model ==

We'll start with the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/articles/mvp-architecture.html#model model], which, as usual, is dealt with in a very sketchy manner; but we'll get a little more ambitious.

First, create the Dark Matter Data configuration folder (dmdconfig); you can actually call this whatever you want, it's just a convention to call it `dmdconfig`.

Beneath this folder you'll create three files, `contacts.dms`, `attributes.dmd` and `classes.dmd`:

{{{
src
    com.google.gwt.sample.contacts
      client
      server
      shared
          dmdconfig
              contacts.dms
              classes.dmd
              attributes.dmd
}}}

=== The Schema: contacts.dms ===
