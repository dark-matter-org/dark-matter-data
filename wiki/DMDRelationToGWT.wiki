That depends.

I guess I sound like a politician or a lawyer with that remark, but it is entirely truthful. The next few sections should clarify the statement.

== Conformance with GWT JRE Emulation ==

There is nothing in the Dark Matter Core (DMC) classes that has any direct dependence on any Google Web Toolkit related concepts, but all DMC classes and all `DmcType` derivatives (the basis for all attribute types) are intended to conform to the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/2.2/RefJreEmulation.html JRE Emulation] guidelines.

By following these guidelines for the classes that you use as the `primitiveType` in your [DMSTypeDefinition TypeDefinitions], you make your code easily usable in both full Java and GWT operational contexts.
