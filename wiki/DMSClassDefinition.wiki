#summary A discussion of the Dark Matter Schema Class Definition Mechanisms

= Class Definitions =

Okay. You've had to wade through some preliminary stuff to get here, but here's where that effort begins to pay off; `ClassDefinitions` are the starting point for the [DMOGenerator generation of Dark Matter Objects].

We're going to start simple and work up from there. Here's the basic form of a `ClassDefinition`:

{{{
ClassDefinition
name
classType    (the type of class)
derivedFrom  (reference to another class definition)
isNamedBy    (the naming attribute)
must[]       (attributes that must exist for the whole object to be valid)
may[]        (attributes that may exist on the class)
}}}
