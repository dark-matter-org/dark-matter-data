#summary Dealing with MVP versus MVC.

= Model View Whatever =

I've been using GWT for about a year now and am always on a learning curve; which is probably a good thing.

When I started this documentation exercise, the only approach to overall application structure I had used was [http://www.sencha.com/products/extgwt/ Sencha's] ExtGWT MVC mechanisms. I had read the varying reviews of this approach and, although it wasn't perfect, it provided me with a clear path forward; it wasn't rocket science.

I'm a relatively lazy sort, so to make my life easier I wrote some code generation tools around the ExtGWT MVC mechanisms so that I could cut down on the amount of hand coding I did for the basic plumbing.

== High Level Structure - Controllers/Applications ==

I wanted to be able to define the main aspects of the framework, namely Controllers, Views and Events (and some other bits) and be able to tie them together easily into an entire Application. I wanted the Controllers to be reusable across different Applications so that I could pick and choose the features I wanted. For instance, if I had built an Alarm Display, I'd like to be able to use that Alarm Display in different Applications that required such a beast. 

What emerged was a structure like this:
