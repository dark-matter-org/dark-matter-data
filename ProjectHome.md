Understanding the data that is managed by an application, be it a web application, a desktop application or any other type of application is crucial to building an application that meets the needs of the users. If you don't understand the data to be managed, you can't build the application; it's that simple. Dark Matter allows you to focus on the data being managed and then allows you to generate much of the infrastructure that's required to persist, transport, present, manipulate and receive event notifications about that data.

The dark-matter group of projects also includes [dark-matter-mvw](https://code.google.com/p/dark-matter-mvw/) and [dark-matter-gxt](https://code.google.com/p/dark-matter-gxt/) which leverage the dark-matter-data code base to generate code that supports Model View Presenter development mechanisms and Sencha's GXT widget set.
