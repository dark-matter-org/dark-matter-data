Serialization
-------------

Move toward GPB approach of defining attribute identifiers within the context of the class.

Have to have a migration mechanism that allows for shift from existing serialization mechanism
to the new approach. This would include:
- regenerating the ClassDefinitions to use the new attribute specification mechanism
  that provides the identifier to be associated with attribute e.g.
  
  ClassDefinition
  name X
  must A
  may  B
  may  C
  
  ClassDefinition
  name X
  must A 1
  may  B 2
  may  B 3

- 


Classes will still require unique identifiers within a .dms - however, move towards a mechanism 
that allows for dopplering of the identifier space i.e. be able to set the base identifier of
a schema at run time. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to generate the schema handling infrastructure from the metaschema!

May need a special mode for the DmwGenerator or something.

Need rules for the DMW space - see dmv rule definitions file for problem
