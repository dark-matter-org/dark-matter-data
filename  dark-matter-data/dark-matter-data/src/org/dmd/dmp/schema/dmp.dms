description The Dark Matter Protocol (DMP) is a general purpose data access/manipulation protocol
 that provides operations for log in, log out, CRUD behaviour, event notification and
 remote method invocation. The protocol concepts are based on the old Open Systems 
 Interaction (OSI) Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and, as such, are also
 designed to operate against hierarchies of objects (although flat object structures
 are perfectly allowable).
