description		The MvwEvent is an autonomous definition of some kind of event that is fired
 and handled by components in a Model-View-Whatever application. Specification of an MvwEvent
 will result the creation of a GwtEvent.Type<H> class and its associated EventHandler class.

description		The LocalEvent is fired by producers that want to define a tightly bound
 event interface so that consumers can register just for events that the producer fires.

description		The BroadcastEvent is fired by producers that want to publish an event on
 the Event Bus. An additional concept associated with BroadcastEvents is that they may be
 associated with an EventChannel. What this means it that when the producer fires a BroadcastEvent
 associated with an EventChannel, all listeners of that EventChannel will receive it. And, since
 many BroadcastEvents can share an EventChannel, it mean sthat you can group together
 events that have something in common.

description		The SingleDMOSelectedEvent is a BroadcastEvent that indicates that a single 
 Dark Matter Object has been selected, usually in an MvwView component. By defining an event
 of this type, your component will have the event added to its event interface and, when that
 event is fired, the framework will also fire a generic DMO event that is handled by the 
 MvwSelectionManager component.

description		The MultipleDMOSelectedEvent is a BroadcastEvent that indicates that multiple
 DMOs have been selected. As with the single select event, a generic DMO event that is
 handled by the MvwSelectionManager is fired as well.

may				firesEvent
may				handlesEvent
description		The Component is an abstract base for classes that define the building blocks
 of Applications. The primary feature of an Component is that it fires and/or handles events.
 Beyond that, a component can be whatever you require it to be. A variety of derived component types
 provide more focussed behavioural units.

name			View
classType       STRUCTURAL

isNamedBy		camelCaseName
must			camelCaseName
may				useBaseClass
description		The View is used to define a reusable set of MVW functionality which
 can be referred to in Application definitions or other Module definitions. Due to
 the fact there is no common base class for Views in GWT, the View definition allows you
 to specific your own base class for the View implementation if you happen to have one.
 That way, you can insert common functonality into the generated abstract View implementations.
 <P>
 Each firesEvent/handlesEvent specified for a View will add that event to the View's interface
 definition.
 <P>
 Generated artifacts: the view's event/data interface,  an abstract view implementation with abstract
 functions for each handlesEvent and set/add data.
