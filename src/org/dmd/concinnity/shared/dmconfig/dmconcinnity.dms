description 		The dark-matter Concinnity schema defines a set of mechanisms
 that allow for ad hoc representation of concepts and various types of relationships
 between them. All Domain Specific Definitions (DSDs) generated as part of the 
 dark-matter mechanisms inherently allow for references to Concinnity.
 <p/>
 Concinnity is defined as: the skillful and harmonious arrangement or fitting together of the different parts of something.
